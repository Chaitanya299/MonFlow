## 2. Component Lifecycle Details

### 🟢 Completed & Tested
- [x] **Universal Parser:** Integer-based paise math with 100% regex coverage.
- [x] **Handshake Logic:** Atomic fetch-and-clear between Native and JS layers.
- [x] **Deduplication Buffer:** 60-second window preventing double-counting.
- [x] **Signed Rule Bundles:** Ed25519-signed dynamic parser updates.
- [x] **P2P Social Pairing:** Deep linking (`monflo://invite`) functionality.
- [x] **Untagged Bucket:** UI and persistence for manual reconciliation.
- [x] **Regex Expansion:** Parsed and validated 25+ real-world transaction/SMS formats covering HDFC, SBI, ICICI, HSBC, Union Bank, YES Bank, BOI, and KVB.

### 🟡 Improvement Needed / Tech Debt
- [ ] **Dependency Audit:** Address 12 "Medium" CVEs found in `package.json` (Vite, esbuild).
- [ ] **Native Test Execution:** Setup `ANDROID_HOME` in agent environment for automated Kotlin runs.

### 🔵 Research Needed
- [ ] **Network Latency:** Waku Gossip performance on high-latency 4G/5G mobile networks.
- [ ] **Device Fragmentation:** Biometric prompt consistency across Samsung/Xiaomi/Pixel OEMs.
- [ ] **TPM Availability:** KeyStore fallback reliability on non-hardware-backed (TEE) devices.
- [ ] **iOS Automation Scope:** Investigating Background Tasks and Notification Service Extension limits on iOS vs Android's "Black Box" strategy.

### 🔴 Yet to be Planned / Future Milestones
- [ ] **UPI Deep-Link Interface:** Integration with external UPI apps for one-tap payback.
- [ ] **Trip Templates:** Pre-defined split patterns for travel (Flights, Stay, Food) with group-wide budgets.
- [ ] **Multi-Currency Support:** Researching exchange rate sync for non-INR transactions.
- [ ] **Budgeting Engine:** Designing the "Bachelor Mode" spending limit alerts.
- [ ] **Merchant Analytics:** Planning the local-only merchant categorization logic.
